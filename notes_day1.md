# marcus's notes for day 1

today I learned how to install ubuntu on windows with the wsl.
in ubuntu we installed a bunch dev dependencies with `apt`.
installed `fish`.
installed `asdf` in `fish`.
changed the `fish` greeting to `'Welcome to Costco. I love you'`.
installed `postgres`. 
we used psql to allow `postgres` to login and gave it a password.
we also added the user 'marcus_g' as the superuser.
learned some things about markdown.
